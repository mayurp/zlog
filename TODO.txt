* Add fmt formatters for any container type (array, list, map, set etc)
* Add log levels
* tidy up compile time string helpers
* tidy up template stuff (extract type traits?)
* write tests - mainly check no copies of data are done

Later (in d3?)
* Conditional output of string depending on level
* Output type registry as yaml
* Output log registry as yaml
